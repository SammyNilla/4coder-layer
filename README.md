# 4coder-layer
My personal hodgepodge of edited snippets from various sources, as well as my own additions to create a personalized custom layer for my personal 4coder use.

## Note
This layer is compatible with 4coder version 4.1.4 and could potentially require substantial modification to work on later versions.  
This repository will be archived for the time being and re-opened when I'm more actively using 4coder again.
